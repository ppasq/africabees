<p>{% trans "We are a drone mapping start-up with the aim of providing detailed and accurate data for African urban and rural landscapes. Our aim is to bring together a community of both drone mapping pilots and end-users, to share accurate 3D mapping data using our geospatial content management system and platform. We intend to empower local pilots to capture the data responsibly and accurately. Our platform provides great software tools under a consistent and easy-to-use interface for interactive maps. The journey has just begun. Welcome to the hive. Buzz buzz" %}</p>
