# Introduction

This directory is used to store static assets for your project. User media files
(FileFields/ImageFields) are not stored here.

The convention for this directory is:

 * css/ — stores CSS files
 * scss/ - stores SCSS files
 * js/ — stores Javascript files
 * img/ — stores image files

# Sass

Stylesheets are written using the SCSS (Sassy CSS) syntax and then built in CSS.
Sass can be used to automatically build CSS from SCSS files. Sass will
watch your SCSS files for changes and recompile. Documentation on how to install and use
Sass can be found at https://sass-lang.com/documentation/

To watch your scss files:
```
$ cd path/to/static/
$ sass --watch scss/main.scss:css/main.css
```
